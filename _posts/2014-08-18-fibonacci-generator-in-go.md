title: "Fibonacci sequence generator in Go"

# {{ page.title }}

When completing one of the mathematical challenge of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), I had to compute some
Fibonacci numbers. I found, with the help of [Fran√ßois Zaninotto](http://redotheweb.com/), a very elegant way to get the
terms of this famous sequence, based on a [StackOverflow answer](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/28445).

As a reminder, the Fibonacci sequence is defined as:

A very naive and simple way to implement it would be the following:

``` go
func GetFibonacci(first int, second int, rank int) int {
	if rank == 1 {
		return first
	}

	if rank == 2 {
		return second
	}

	return GetFibonacci(first, second, rank - 1) + GetFibonacci(first, second, rank - 2)
}
```

This is just a retranscription of previous formulas. But using Go in this case does not bring anything special. So, here
is a more elegant and Go-friendly way, including a generator:

``` go
func FibonacciGenerator(first int, second int) chan int {
	c := make(chan int)

	go func() {
		for i, j := first, second ; ; j, i = i + j, j {
			c <- i
		}
	}()

	return c
}
```
As the initial conditions may vary, we parametrize the first and second Fibonacci terms. Then, we create a new channel
containing only integers with the `make` function. Consider a channel like a FIFO stack: you can insert some values in
it with the `->` (move towards) operator or consume them with `<-` (take from). This is the most awesome and damn simple
feature of Go language. With channels, you can prevent your code from becoming a callback hell all Node.js developers
already experienced.

Then, we declare an anonymous go-routine. A Go routine is simply executed in a separate thread. Just think about it as
an asynchronous function. All the Fibonacci logical is located in the `for` clause, using the possibility to assign
several variables with a single `=` operator. The following line is the key one: we write `i` value into the channel.
Yet, writing into a channel blocks current thread until the value is read. In this case, it simply yield the returned
Fibonacci term.

To write a list of 10 first Fibonacci numbers, you can simply use the following code:

``` go
import "fmt"

// Generator code

func main() {
    generator := FibonacciGenerator(1, 1)
    for i := 0 ; i < 10 ; i++ {
        fmt.Println(<- generator)
    }
}
```
So short but elegant code... The more in Go I develop, the more addicted I become! :)
